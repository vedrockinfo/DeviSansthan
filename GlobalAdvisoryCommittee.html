                      ImaginAction (California). I have also pioneered in my
                      initiative of Theatre- in- Education in teaching English
                      Literature, Social Science and History curriculum in
                      schools through Applied Theatre.

                      Cindy Charles is the Founder and President of Kupanda
                      Sisters, Inc. as well as an Executive Administrator for JP
                      Morgan Chase & Co. An advocate of literacy for all,
                      Charles has focused much of her career creating
                      opportunities that inspire children and women in literacy.
                      Kupanda Sisters, Inc. mission has been to uplift women and
                      young people in underserved communities by providing them
                      with quality literacy resources and skills that will equip
                      and empower them to transform their reality, unleash their
                      full potential, and become meaningful contributors to
                      their communities and our world. Kupanda Sisters Inc.,
                      began providing services in early 2019 to more than 20
                      children at the Sophia Primary School in Georgetown Guyana
                      in order to build their literacy levels to meet academic
                      standards under the slogan “Together We Rise.” The
                      organization also focuses on empowering women in Guyana
                      through wellness, entrepreneurial workshops, and awareness
                      campaigns. A native of Guyana, South America, Charles grew
                      up in a small village on the East Bank of Essequibo named
                      Parika. Her struggles at home added to her academic
                      challenges, and with limited resources available, she felt
                      like another statistic and another voiceless child without
                      a future.

                      Dr. Fred Mednick began his career as a teacher and school
                      principal. In 2000, he founded Teachers Without Borders
                      (TWB) to connect teacher leaders to information and each
                      other to close the education divide. “Brains are evenly
                      distributed throughout the world,” he is fond of saying,
                      “but education is not.” Teachers Without Borders champions
                      teachers as critically-important and truly sustainable
                      change agents. Today, the Teachers Without Borders
                      membership of teacher leaders spans 171 countries. TWB
                      offers a suite of free teacher development courses,
                      workshops, resources and initiatives in a range of topics
                      such as teacher preparation, girls’ education, peace and
                      human rights, and education in emergencies, all of which
                      are aligned with global competencies and the Sustainable
                      Development Goals. Teachers Without Borders has been
                      awarded the Champion of African Education Award, the 2018
                      Luxembourg Peace Prize, and the 2018 Ahmadiyya Muslim
                      Prize for Peace. Dr. Mednick is also a professor in
                      Education Sciences at the Free University of Brussels. His
                      book, “I Want to Meet the King of America: Stories of
                      Remarkable Teachers” includes first-hand accounts of
                      teachers as community change agents and essays celebrating
                      Teachers Without Borders’s two-plus decades.

                      Jon Corippo describes himself as a “formerly disgruntled
                      student.” He made it almost all the way through school
                      with a 2.9 GPA. His final three semesters in Advertising
                      changed everything, though: Advertising classes were
                      project-based. Jon’s grades shot to nearly 4.0. 20 years
                      later, Jon had served a decade at the K-8 level, opened a
                      1-1, PBL, Google-based high school, served in two county
                      offices, including as an Assistant Superintendent and IT
                      Director. Jon has been recognized as a County Teacher of
                      the Year, a 20 to Watch Educator by the NSBA, and was Top
                      100 Influencer in the 2019 EdTech Digest Awards and a 2020
                      Edtech Digest Awards Trendsetter Winner. Jon also holds
                      the Apple Distinguished Educator, Google Certified
                      Innovator, and Microsoft Innovative Educator badges. Jon
                      served as the Chief Learning Officer for CUE for over half
                      a decade, leading the training of over 60,000 educators in
                      the last 5 years. Jon is also the Co-Author of the
                      Eduprotocol Field Guide Books 1 and 2 and assisted with
                      the new Eduprotocols Math Edition. The Eduprotocol Field
                      Guide series helps teachers to be far more effective (how
                      about a 4x academic boost?) and work less (how about being
                      done 6 weeks earlier than normal?). Eduprotocols are free,
                      shareable, and work in nearly ANY grade level or subject
                      so they are super portable. Jon lives in Coarsegold,
                      California, near Yosemite, with his wife (a very
                      successful educator and administrator), three children,
                      and a random number of free-range chickens.

                      Recipient of the 2014 Literarian Award for Outstanding
                      Service to the American Literary Community Born in
                      Zanesville, Ohio, Zimmer attended the University of Iowa
                      and graduated from George Washington University Law
                      School. She worked as a corporate attorney for several
                      years in Washington, DC while also volunteering as a tutor
                      for Martha’s Table, a multi-service community organization
                      for the District’s families in need. Realizing that the
                      children she was working with had no books to call their
                      own spurred Zimmer to take action and in 1992, Zimmer
                      founded First Book. To provide quality books to
                      underserved children, Zimmer developed two groundbreaking
                      models of social entrepreneurship: the First Book
                      Marketplace, an award-winning, self-sustaining program
                      that purchases new books from publishers and makes them
                      available to educators and program leaders at affordable
                      prices, and the First Book National Book Bank, which
                      serves as the nation’s largest clearinghouse for new books
                      donated by publishers. In addition, First Book’s
                      market-driven Stories for All Project is serving as a
                      catalyst to increase diversity in children’s books, so
                      that all children can see themselves in books. With Zimmer
                      at the helm, First Book distributes millions of new books
                      and educational resources every year to children from
                      low-income families through a growing network of schools,
                      programs, churches, and institutions across the United
                      States, as well as in as well as in Canada, Peru, Haiti,
                      Jamaica, India and other countries. A passionate advocate
                      for social entrepreneurship, educational equity, and the
                      importance of literacy to further economic competitiveness
                      and global understanding, Zimmer has participated in some
                      of the world’s most prestigious economic forums. In 2013,
                      Zimmer was a presenter at the University of Oxford’s
                      “Power Shift: Forum for Women in the World Economy” at the
                      Saïd Business School at Oxford. Zimmer and First Book were
                      also featured at the 2013 Clinton Global Initiative.
                      Zimmer was also a presenter and blogger at the World
                      Economic Forum in Beijing in 2012, served as a member of
                      the World Economic Forum’s Global Agenda Council on Social
                      Entrepreneurship, and was featured as a presenter at the
                      World Economic Forum in Davos in 2010. Zimmer has won
                      numerous awards and honors, including the Carle Honors
                      Angel Award in 2009, the first ever American Marketing

                      United States in 2007 from the Schwab Foundation for
                      Social Entrepreneurship. She currently serves as a member
                      of the Board of Directors for Ashoka, which works to
                      ensure that social entrepreneurs and their innovations
                      continue to inspire a new generation of local
                      change-makers. She also serves on the Youth Venture Board

                      Mary McCool Berry is a literacy specialist who worked with
                      children as a public school educator for over three
                      decades in the United States.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Mary is also a grants writer; she wrote several grants,
                      which resulted in awards totaling thousands of dollars.
                      The grant monies provided materials for children during
                      her teaching career. Mary’s grant awards involved science,
                      math, reading, writing, speaking, and history. Mary’s
                      organization, ‘Schools with Soul,’ promotes active
                      learning to build students’ background knowledge.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Ms. McCool Berry passionately believes schools and
                      organizations must provide experiences for children to use
                      their imagination and ingenuity through project-based or
                      problem-based learning.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In 2019, Ms. McCool Berry retired from teaching to devote
                      time to educating the public about the importance of
                      ‘Literacy for All.’
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Ms. McCool Berry traveled to the island nation of Saint
                      Lucia as a volunteer and taught teachers and students
                      using the Wilson Reading System in early 2020.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Recently, Ms. McCool Berry co-wrote a literacy grant to
                      the United States Libary of Congress for Wilson Reading
                      materials for the island of Saint Lucia. A decision is
                      currently pending for this grant.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Mary appeared on the Thinklum.com podcast in February 2021
                      in a talk titled, “Parents Do Not Know What is Available
                      to Teach Their Kids Reading.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Mary currently teaches students of all ages across the
                      United States to assist those who struggle with literacy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Mary works very closely with parents to educate them about
                      literacy in American schools.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Soon, Mary will have a website, ‘Readingkeys.com’ to
                      assist parents in navigating the maze of literacy
                      instruction.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Achieving literacy for all people across the planet is the
                      work to which Mary McCool Berry is now dedicating her time
                      and skill.

                      Driven with the strong belief that everyone deserves equal
                      opportunities regardless of their background, Shrutika
                      left her corporate job in search for something more
                      meaningful. Her journey began in 2009 as a teacher in a
                      low-income school where she worked closely with the
                      community for two years and witnessed the stark realities
                      of inequity; reinforcing that her shift to the sector was,
                      indeed, the right choice.

                    <p>
                      Over the years, Shrutika has worked directly with
                      beneficiaries, set up operations for NGOs like Teach for
                      India, liaised with the government and other stakeholders
                      to drive impact. Shrutika was also instrumental in the
                      launch of the India School Leadership Institute - the
                      first school leadership training program in Mumbai. It is
                      through her work that Shrutika hopes to play a small role
                      in changing the status quo. At Dasra, Shrutika is a part
                      of the capacity building team, working on the Adolescents
                      Collaborative and supporting organizations in their
                      journey to impact. In her free time, Shrutika takes a deep
                      interest in Indian Mythology and actively supports many
                      social causes.
