                                <p>Every parent wants the best education for their child. But is there more to education
                                    than rows of children listening to
                                    a teacher and copying into their notebooks?
                                </p>
                                <p>ALfA: Accelerating Learning for All breaks the
                                    shackles of the industrial education system,
                                    revolutionizing the school experience through
                                    peer learning and hands-on activities. The ALfA
                                    program enables children and adults alike to
                                    learn foundational literacy and numeracy in
                                    months rather than years. Beyond reading, writing
                                    and arithmetic, ALfA builds the crucial life skills of
                                    collaboration, creativity, citizenship and character.
                                    Both a classroom guide for teachers and an
                                    implementation roadmap for policymakers, this
                                    book explores a transformative approach to
                                    teaching and learning. Sprinkled with anecdotes
                                    from teachers, principals & students, Accelerating
                                    Learning for All inspires and equips us to build a
                                    better education system.</p>
